# Diabetes-Risk-Warning
The project involved conducting a comparative analysis of ve machine
learning models: Perceptron, ID3, SVM, Neural Network (MLP), and Logistic Regression.
After performing data preprocessing and evaluating performance metrics such as
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, Logistic Regression was identi ed as the most
effective model with an accuracy of approximately 80%. The nal solution featured a
functional graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to receive real
time risk assessments by inputting health data such as Glucose levels, BMI, and Age.
